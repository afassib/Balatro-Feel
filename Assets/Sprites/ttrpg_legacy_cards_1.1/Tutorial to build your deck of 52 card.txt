Since this pack have too many card to be sorted without being a huge mess of folders, I suggest you to find what you need with the search tool of your OS

You can find your needs with those key word, for a good result, you need a Family Keyword, a Color Keyword, and a Design Keyword - If done correctly, you will always have 22 results (Ace to 10 and all the variation's race of Jack, Queen, King)

--- Family Key word (only One) ---

-Spade
-Diamond
-Club
-Heart

--- Color Key word (only One) ---

-Black
-Blue
-Bronze
-Cyan
-Gold
-Green
-Orange
-Purple
-Red
-Silver

--- Design Key word (only One) ---

-Design_1
-Design_2
-Design_3
-Design_4

--- Race Keyword for Jack / Queen / King (only one)(Optionnal) ---

-Human
-Goblin
-Elves
-Dwarf

For exemple, I want to have all the BLUE SPADE card with the 4TH DESIGN, all I need is to write on the research "spade blue design_4" then copy / past what I need and erase the Jack / Queen / King of other race I don't want to use

With this method, you can build your deck of 52 cards in no time ! Just don't forget to check the folder "extra" for the back of cards and jokers
